The student.cpp file contains the implementation of the member functions for the CStudent and CStudent::CPG_Student classes, as well as the CCourse class. 
These classes handle student and course information, providing functions to set and retrieve various attributes. 

Below is the documentation for the functions in the student.cpp file:

string student_email_password : a variable for the email password of the student.
float student_grades[] : an array for the grades of the student in different subjects.
float student_score : a variable for the calculated score or GPA of the student.
