Overview

The main.cpp file is the entry point of the program. 
It contains the main() function, which manages the registration and retrieval of information for students and courses. 
The program allows registering undergraduate and postgraduate students, adding courses, and displaying the information for both students and courses.

Dependencies
The code includes the following dependencies:

"student.h": A header file that likely contains the definition of the CStudent and CCourse classes.
<iostream>: The standard input/output stream library, used for console input and output operations.
<string>: The string library, used for working with string objects.
using namespace std;: A using directive that allows using names from the std namespace without explicitly qualifying them.

main() Function
The main() function serves as the entry point of the program. It performs the following steps:

Prompt the user to enter the number of students to register (n_students).
Prompt the user to enter the number of courses to add (n_courses).
Declare arrays of CStudent and CCourse objects with sizes based on the user input.
Iterate over the array of students and register each student using the registerStudent() function of the CStudent class.
Iterate over the array of courses and add each course using the add_Course() function of the CCourse class.
Iterate over the array of students and display the information of each student using the getStudentInfo() function of the CStudent class.
Iterate over the array of courses and display the information of each course using the get_Course_Info() function of the CCourse class.
Prompt the user to enter the number of postgraduate students to register (n_pg_students).
Declare an array of CStudent::CPG_Student objects with a size based on the user input.
Iterate over the array of postgraduate students and register each student using the registerStudent() function of the CStudent::CPG_Student class.
Prompt the user to enter the job title of each postgraduate student.
Display the information of each postgraduate student and their corresponding job title.

Code Structure:
The code follows a procedural structure, with the main logic contained within the main() function. 
The key steps, such as registering students, adding courses, and displaying information, are performed using loops and function calls.

The code demonstrates the usage of classes, objects, arrays, and member functions to manage student and course information.
